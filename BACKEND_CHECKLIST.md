# Backend Development Checklist

This checklist will guide the backend implementation for your Dropics application, ensuring robust, production-ready features tightly integrated with your React/Next.js frontend. The stack includes Next.js (API routes), Supabase (auth, database, storage), Rust Solana SDK (blockchain), and Vercel (deployment).

---

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] **Create a new backend branch** for development.
- [ ] **Set up Supabase project** (auth, database, storage buckets).
- [ ] **Configure environment variables** for Supabase, Solana, and Vercel.
- [ ] **Set up Rust workspace** for Solana blockchain logic (separate crate/module).
- [ ] **Integrate Rust with Next.js** via FFI or API endpoints (e.g., using a microservice or serverless function).
- [ ] **Configure Vercel for monorepo/multi-language deployment** if needed.

## 2. Authentication & User Management
- [ ] **Supabase Auth integration** (email/password, OAuth, magic link, etc.).
- [ ] **API endpoints for user profile CRUD** (name, email, phone, avatar, etc.).
- [ ] **Account settings endpoints** (update info, change password, delete account).
- [ ] **Email verification, password reset, and notifications**.
- [ ] **Role-based access control** (admin, user, etc.).

## 3. Product & Catalog Management
- [ ] **API endpoints for products** (CRUD: create, read, update, delete).
- [ ] **Category, color, and tag management**.
- [ ] **Product images/media storage** (Supabase Storage).
- [ ] **Featured, new arrivals, bestsellers, and search endpoints**.
- [ ] **Product reviews and ratings**.

## 4. Cart & Checkout
- [ ] **Cart endpoints** (add, update, remove, fetch cart items).
- [ ] **Checkout API** (order creation, validation, summary).
- [ ] **Order management** (CRUD, status updates, history).
- [ ] **Payment integrations**:
    - [ ] **Stripe** (card payments, webhooks for confirmation/cancellation).
    - [ ] **Crypto** (BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC) via Rust Solana SDK:
        - [ ] Generate payment addresses.
        - [ ] Verify on-chain payments.
        - [ ] Confirm and update order status on payment.

## 5. Wishlist & Account Features
- [ ] **Wishlist endpoints** (add/remove/fetch user wishlist items).
- [ ] **User addresses, notifications, payment methods, and settings endpoints**.
- [ ] **Order history and tracking**.

## 6. Blog, Tutorials, Inspiration, Careers
- [ ] **API endpoints for blog posts, tutorials, inspiration, and careers** (CRUD, featured, categories).
- [ ] **Admin endpoints for content management**.

## 7. Contact, Newsletter, and Support
- [ ] **Contact form endpoint** (store messages, send email notifications).
- [ ] **Newsletter signup endpoint** (store emails, integrate with email service provider).
- [ ] **FAQ, returns, certifications, and privacy endpoints** (static or dynamic content).

## 8. Blockchain (Solana) Integration
- [ ] **Rust Solana SDK microservice/module**:
    - [ ] Payment transaction creation and verification.
    - [ ] Wallet connection and signature verification.
    - [ ] Expose REST/gRPC endpoints for Next.js to consume.
    - [ ] Security: validate all inputs, handle errors robustly.
- [ ] **Testnet/mainnet configuration** for development and production.

## 9. Security & Best Practices
- [ ] **Input validation and sanitization** on all endpoints.
- [ ] **Rate limiting and abuse prevention**.
- [ ] **Authentication/authorization middleware** for protected routes.
- [ ] **Audit logging for sensitive actions**.
- [ ] **Environment variable management** (never commit secrets).
- [ ] **CORS configuration** for API endpoints.

## 10. Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Unit and integration tests** for all API endpoints (Jest, Rust test framework).
- [ ] **End-to-end tests** (Cypress/Playwright for frontend-backend integration).
- [ ] **Test blockchain transactions on Solana devnet**.
- [ ] **Mock external APIs for CI/CD**.

## 11. CI/CD & Deployment
- [ ] **GitHub Actions for build, test, and deploy**.
- [ ] **Vercel deployment configuration** (production and preview environments).
- [ ] **Production build verification** (Next.js, Rust, Supabase integration).
- [ ] **Automated database migrations** (Supabase CLI or SQL scripts).
- [ ] **Push production-ready code to GitHub main branch**.
- [ ] **Monitor deployment and error logs on Vercel**.

## 12. Documentation
- [ ] **API documentation** (OpenAPI/Swagger or README docs).
- [ ] **Developer onboarding guide** (setup, environment, deployment).
- [ ] **Usage examples for all endpoints**.

---

**Note:**
- Keep frontend and backend tightly coupled via clear API contracts (TypeScript types/interfaces shared if possible).
- Use environment variables for all secrets and sensitive config.
- Regularly review and update this checklist as features evolve.
