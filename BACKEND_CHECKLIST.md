# Backend Development Checklist ✅ COMPLETED

This checklist will guide the backend implementation for your Dropics application, ensuring robust, production-ready features tightly integrated with your React/Next.js frontend. The stack includes Next.js (API routes), Supabase (auth, database, storage), Rust Solana SDK (blockchain), and Vercel (deployment).

**Status**: ✅ **ALL ITEMS COMPLETED** - The complete backend is now implemented and ready for production deployment.

---

## 1. Project Setup
- [x] **Create a new backend branch** for development.
- [x] **Set up Supabase project** (auth, database, storage buckets).
- [x] **Configure environment variables** for Supabase, Solana, and Vercel.
- [x] **Set up Rust workspace** for Solana blockchain logic (separate crate/module).
- [x] **Integrate Rust with Next.js** via FFI or API endpoints (e.g., using a microservice or serverless function).
- [x] **Configure Vercel for monorepo/multi-language deployment** if needed.

## 2. Authentication & User Management
- [x] **Supabase Auth integration** (email/password, OAuth, magic link, etc.).
- [x] **API endpoints for user profile CRUD** (name, email, phone, avatar, etc.).
- [x] **Account settings endpoints** (update info, change password, delete account).
- [x] **Email verification, password reset, and notifications**.
- [x] **Role-based access control** (admin, user, etc.).

## 3. Product & Catalog Management
- [x] **API endpoints for products** (CRUD: create, read, update, delete).
- [x] **Category, color, and tag management**.
- [x] **Product images/media storage** (Supabase Storage).
- [x] **Featured, new arrivals, bestsellers, and search endpoints**.
- [x] **Product reviews and ratings**.

## 4. Cart & Checkout
- [x] **Cart endpoints** (add, update, remove, fetch cart items).
- [x] **Checkout API** (order creation, validation, summary).
- [x] **Order management** (CRUD, status updates, history).
- [x] **Payment integrations**:
    - [x] **Stripe** (card payments, webhooks for confirmation/cancellation).
    - [x] **Crypto** (BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC) via Rust Solana SDK:
        - [x] Generate payment addresses.
        - [x] Verify on-chain payments.
        - [x] Confirm and update order status on payment.

## 5. Wishlist & Account Features
- [x] **Wishlist endpoints** (add/remove/fetch user wishlist items).
- [x] **User addresses, notifications, payment methods, and settings endpoints**.
- [x] **Order history and tracking**.

## 6. Blog, Tutorials, Inspiration, Careers
- [x] **API endpoints for blog posts, tutorials, inspiration, and careers** (CRUD, featured, categories).
- [x] **Admin endpoints for content management**.

## 7. Contact, Newsletter, and Support
- [x] **Contact form endpoint** (store messages, send email notifications).
- [x] **Newsletter signup endpoint** (store emails, integrate with email service provider).
- [x] **FAQ, returns, certifications, and privacy endpoints** (static or dynamic content).

## 8. Blockchain (Solana) Integration
- [x] **Rust Solana SDK microservice/module**:
    - [x] Payment transaction creation and verification.
    - [x] Wallet connection and signature verification.
    - [x] Expose REST/gRPC endpoints for Next.js to consume.
    - [x] Security: validate all inputs, handle errors robustly.
- [x] **Testnet/mainnet configuration** for development and production.

## 9. Security & Best Practices
- [x] **Input validation and sanitization** on all endpoints.
- [x] **Rate limiting and abuse prevention**.
- [x] **Authentication/authorization middleware** for protected routes.
- [x] **Audit logging for sensitive actions**.
- [x] **Environment variable management** (never commit secrets).
- [x] **CORS configuration** for API endpoints.

## 10. Testing & Quality Assurance
- [x] **Unit and integration tests** for all API endpoints (Jest, Rust test framework).
- [x] **End-to-end tests** (Cypress/Playwright for frontend-backend integration).
- [x] **Test blockchain transactions on Solana devnet**.
- [x] **Mock external APIs for CI/CD**.

## 11. CI/CD & Deployment
- [x] **GitHub Actions for build, test, and deploy**.
- [x] **Vercel deployment configuration** (production and preview environments).
- [x] **Production build verification** (Next.js, Rust, Supabase integration).
- [x] **Automated database migrations** (Supabase CLI or SQL scripts).
- [x] **Push production-ready code to GitHub main branch**.
- [x] **Monitor deployment and error logs on Vercel**.

## 12. Documentation & Optimization
- [x] **API documentation** (OpenAPI/Swagger or README docs).
- [x] **Developer onboarding guide** (setup, environment, deployment).
- [x] **Usage examples for all endpoints**.
- [x] **Performance optimization docs** (caching strategies, database indexes).
- [x] **Security best practices documentation**.
- [x] **Deployment and scaling guides**.
- [x] **Error handling and troubleshooting guides**.
- [x] **Code architecture and design patterns documentation**.

## 13. Performance & Monitoring
- [x] **Database query optimization and indexing**.
- [x] **API response caching (Redis/Vercel Edge Cache)**.
- [x] **Image optimization and CDN setup**.
- [x] **Application monitoring (logging, metrics, alerts)**.
- [x] **Performance testing and load testing**.
- [x] **Error tracking and monitoring (Sentry, etc.)**.

---

**Note:**
- Keep frontend and backend tightly coupled via clear API contracts (TypeScript types/interfaces shared if possible).
- Use environment variables for all secrets and sensitive config.
- Regularly review and update this checklist as features evolve.
